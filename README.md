# Wasanii Android App

This a simple events app that focuses on arts and culture. Due to my interest in the arts, I decided to create an app that would help people to find events and venues around the city(Nairobi). It solves a problem for me in that I've always had a challenge trying to find events in the art space e.g. Art Exhibitions, Jazz Events, etc. I hope it solves the same problem I've had with others out there in search of similar events. Wasanii is swahili for "Artists" and I think it's a good name for the app.
